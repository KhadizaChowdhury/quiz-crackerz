                            The Router in React JS is primarily used to <strong>create Single Page Web Apps.</strong> In the application, React Router is utilized to define various routes. When a user enters a URL into your browser and the URL route equals one of several 'pathways' as in the router folder, the user is sent to that route.

                            <p>Here are a few benefits of Context API that give it an edge: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The Context API <strong>helps share data between components which you can't easily share with props</strong>, for example, complex data objects.
                                </li>
                                <li>React Context API provides a way to send data like userid, auth, and theme data through the component tree without sending any props manually at every level.</li>
                                <li>
                                    We can also share specific states with multiple components instead through props manually. In some use cases, ideal for theming, localization, authentication etc.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
